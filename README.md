Who Owns your Country
-------------------

Who Owns your Country. This codebase runs the website [proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br](http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br/).

"Who Owns your Country" is a plugin for Wordpress which uses the methodology developped by EITA (http://eita.org.br) and IMD (http://maisdemocracia.org.br) for the project "WHO OWNS BRAZIL".

It connects enterprises data to build Power Networks and a ranking of the most powerful actors in this constellation, allowing visitors to see the data in a variety of ways, including charts and interactive network maps (using the cytiscape.js library).

For more information on the methodology, visit http://www.proprietariosdobrasil.org.br/index.php/en/ . We also have a paper about the methodology in English which will soon be available.

Installing
-------------------

You must follow the common steps to install a plugin in Wordpress: download the files in a folder called "whoowns" inside the wp-content/plugins folder. Then, as administrator, click on "Activate" in the "Who Owns" plugin.

You can configure some of the settings in the menu on the left, called "Owners".

Using the plugin in your template
--------------------

In this 0.8 version, you need to understand the plugin's features to change your template and create factsheets and graphics of the owners.

We recommend that you look at http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br for an idea, and contact us if you need to look at examples of template customizations to show the owner data and networks.

We'll be happy to help you!

In version 0.9 (coming soon!) the factsheets and custom search forms will be automatically available for your template. We will also add a "screenshots" section so that you can better understand the features available.



Contributions
-------------------

We will be glad to collaborate with other actors who wish to use the plugin in their country and make it better. Don't hesitate to join us in this common effort to contribute for a real democratic world, in which the economic powers are not directing the whole economy of the countries!

If you would like to send a question to us, send your message to contato@proprietariosdobrasil.org.br .
