Who Owns your Country
-------------------

Who Owns your Country. This codebase runs the website [proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br](http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br/).

"Who Owns your Country" is a plugin for Wordpress which uses the methodology developped by EITA (http://eita.org.br) and IMD (http://maisdemocracia.org.br) for the project "WHO OWNS BRAZIL".

It connects enterprises data to build Power Networks and a ranking of the most powerful actors in this constellation, allowing visitors to see the data in a variety of ways, including charts and interactive network maps (using the cytiscape.js library).

For more information on the methodology, visit http://www.proprietariosdobrasil.org.br/index.php/en/ . We also have a paper about the methodology in English which will soon be available.

Installing
-------------------

You must follow the common steps to install a plugin in Wordpress: download the files in a folder called "whoowns" inside the wp-content/plugins folder. Then, as administrator, click on "Activate" in the "Who Owns" plugin.

You can configure some of the settings in the menu on the left, called "Owners".


Contributions
-------------------

We will be glad to collaborate with other actors who wish to use the plugin in their country and make it better. Don't hesitate to join us in this common effort to contribute for a real democratic world, in which the economic powers are not directing the whole economy of the countries!
