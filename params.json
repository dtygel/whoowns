This codebase runs the website [proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br](http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br/).\r\n\r\n\"Who Owns your Country\" is a plugin for Wordpress which uses the methodology developped by EITA (http://eita.org.br) and IMD (http://maisdemocracia.org.br) for the project \"WHO OWNS BRAZIL\".\r\n\r\nIt connects enterprises data to build Power Networks and a ranking of the most powerful actors in this constellation, allowing visitors to see the data in a variety of ways, including charts and interactive network maps (using the cytiscape.js library).\r\n\r\nFor more information on the methodology, visit http://www.proprietariosdobrasil.org.br/index.php/en/ . We also have a paper about the methodology in English which will soon be available.\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nYou must follow the common steps to install a plugin in Wordpress: download the files in a folder called \"whoowns\" inside the wp-content/plugins folder. Then, as administrator, click on \"Activate\" in the \"Who Owns\" plugin.\r\n\r\nYou can configure some of the settings in the menu on the left, called \"Owners\".\r\n\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWe will be glad to collaborate with other actors who wish to use the plugin in their country and make it better. Don't hesitate to join us in this common effort to contribute for a real democratic world, in which the economic powers are not directing the whole economy of the countries!\r\n\r\nIf you would like to send a question to us, send your message to contato@proprietariosdobrasil.org.br .\r\n\r\n\r\nOwnership\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nCopyLeft 2013, Daniel Tygel and members of EITA and IMD.
