Calculate the Economic Power Networks in your country, showing enterprises, people and government networks through charts, maps and factsheets.

== Description ==

=About=

What is the economic power structure of the private groups in this country? Who are the actors who accumulate the most power in this structure, and what is the relationship amongst them? What is the degree of influence of this invisible power structure, over government decisions in terms of development and economic policies? How does the State relate and feed this power structure and what are the counterparts of this relationship for the well being of society? It is with the objective to respond to these and other questions that we built the “Brazil's Owners” Project and corresponding methodology.

"Who Owns your Country" is a plugin for Wordpress which uses the methodology developped by EITA (http://eita.org.br) and IMD (http://maisdemocracia.org.br) for the project "WHO OWNS BRAZIL" (http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br).

It connects enterprises, people and government's ownership and revenue information to build Power Networks and a ranking of the most powerful actors in this constellation, allowing visitors to see the data in a variety of ways, including charts, factsheets and interactive network maps.

For more information on the methodology, visit http://www.proprietariosdobrasil.org.br/index.php/en/ . We also have a paper about the methodology in English which will soon be available.

=Contributions=

We will be glad to collaborate with other actors who wish to use the plugin in their country and make it better. Don't hesitate to join us in this common effort to contribute for a real democratic world, in which the economic powers are not directing the whole economy of the countries!

If you would like to send a question to us, send your message to contato@proprietariosdobrasil.org.br .

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file and unzip it in the wp-content/plugins folder of your wordpress installation
1. Go to the plugins administration panel in your WP website and activate the plugin
1. You can change settings in the "Owners" configuration menu.

=Using the plugin in your template=

In this 0.8 version, you need to understand the plugin's features to change your template and create factsheets and graphics of the owners.

We recommend that you look at http://proprietariosdobrasil.eita.org.br for an idea, and contact us if you need to look at examples of template customizations to show the owner data and networks.

We'll be happy to help you!

In version 0.9 (coming soon!) the factsheets and custom search forms will be automatically available for your template. We will also add a "screenshots" section so that you can better understand the features available.
